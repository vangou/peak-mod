Introducing, "PEAK Unlimited", a mod for PEAK which raises the lobby max player count so that you may play with all of your friends, only the host needs to have this mod! 

## Features:
- Raises the Max Player Count
- Adds extra marshmallows for all your friends! 
- Has an easy to use configuration file

## Configuration
- The extra marshmallows feature may be turned off in the configuration! (It is on by default)
- Configuration can be found at: (steam directory)\PEAK\BepInEx\config\PeakUnlimited.cfg
- The default max is 20, I would recommend lowering this value in the configuration if you know you won't be playing with this many people
- Game may become unstable with lots of players
- Can overwrite the number of marshmallows to a desired value.

## Mods That Improve The Multiplayer Experience
- Check out [PeakUnlimitedEndScreen](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/kaosz/PEAK_FixUnlimitedEndScreen/) by kaosz - prevents the end screen getting stuck with extra players!
- [Voice Volume Saver](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/glarmer/PEAK_Voice_Volume_Saver/) - Saves the volume of all your friends, no more adjusting their volume every time you load in!

## Manual Installation
Only the host needs to install!

1.) Download Bepinex from [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.23.3/BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.3.zip) <br>
2.) Extract the contents of that zip into your game directory (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PEAK) resulting in a folder that has the following files: <br>

3.) Start the game and close it again, this does the first time set up for Bepinex. <br>
4.) Navigate to ...\PEAK\BepInEx\plugins, copy and paste the PeakUnlimited.dll from releases into this folder. <br>
5.) Run the game <br>

## Important
- DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE COMPLAIN ABOUT BUGS TO THE DEVELOPERS WHILE USING MODS. UNINSTALL MODS IF YOU ENCOUNTER BUGS AND THEN REPORT THEM IF THEY ARE STILL PRESENT.
- Please search the PEAK Steam discussions if you face bugs as they are likely caused by the game and not the mod, currently there are no known issues caused by this mod. If you continue to experience issues then please reach out.

## Help
- You can find your PEAK folder by **right clicking the game in your Steam library** then > **Manage** > **Browse Local Files**
- If you have issues with auto install, try manually installing with the version of BepInEx that I link above.
- Please report issues to [the mods github](https://github.com/glarmer/PEAK-Unlimited/), alternatively I will periodically check the [steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3501916945&tscn=1750268995)
