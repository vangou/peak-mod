# Item Scroller

You can now switch items using the scroll wheel.

Due to the fact that some items also use the scroll wheel for function you need to wait atleast 0.75 seconds (by default) to be able to use their scroll function or else you might accidentally scroll over them


## Config

| Key             | Description                                                                                                 | Notice                                                                               | Default |
